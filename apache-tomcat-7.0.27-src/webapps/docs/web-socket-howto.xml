<p>Tomcat provides support for WebSocket as defined by
   <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a>. This feature is
   not yet finalised and you are encouraged to provide feedback in the form
   of bug reports (via
   <a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla">Bugzilla</a>), suggested API
   changes (via the <a href="mailto:dev@tomcat.apache.org">dev list</a>) or
   other comments (again via the <a href="mailto:dev@tomcat.apache.org">dev
   list</a>).</p>
</section>

<section name="Application development">
<p>The API used for application development has not yet been finalised. Rather
   than document something here that will quickly be out of date, please see the
   Javadoc for the
   <a href="api/index.html?org/apache/catalina/websocket/package-summary.html">
   <code>org.apache.catalina.websocket</code></a> package. The Javadoc
   pages are not included with Tomcat binary distributions. To view them
   locally you would have to download and install "Full documentation"
   distribution, or build it from sources. You can
   also read this on the Apache Tomcat web site. Start with the
   <a href="api/index.html?org/apache/catalina/websocket/WebSocketServlet.html">
   <code>WebSocketServlet</code></a> class.</p>

<p>There are also several example applications that demonstrate how the
   WebSocket API can be used. You'll need to look at both the client side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/webapps/examples/websocket/">
   html</a> and the server side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/websocket/">
   code</a>.</p>

<p>Do keep in mind that the API is fluid and is likely to change, possibly
   significantly, between point releases. The documentation will be updated once
   the API is considered stable (unlikely to be until JSR 356 is complete).</p>
